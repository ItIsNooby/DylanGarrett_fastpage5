Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a callable block of code from anywhere in a program . Parameters: limitations for code to follow . Arguments: a value passed though a function when it gets called. . Modularity: linking multiple modules then combining them to create a complete system . Procedural Abstraction: abstraction that occurs in a specific order to avoid errors . What are some other names for procedures?: subprograms or subroutines . Why are procedures effective?: procedures help to simplify code . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = 7 print(&quot;Binary of 7 is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) . Binary of 7 is: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . list = [1,2,3,4,12,5,6,17,43,6.2322] print(min(list)) print(max(list)) . 1 43 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . x = int(input()) print(bin(x)[2:]) . 101 .",

Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example .

This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] .

To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running.

As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. .

Rather, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. The value of j does not need to be between 0 and k. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive. . | Q11: Incorrect. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is only compared with the elements that follow it. . | Q13: Incorrect. The procedure traverses this list and never encounters a positive value. The procedure then returns false as intended. . | Q14: Incorrect. When numCorrect is 7, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed as intended. . | Q17: Incorrect. The Internet was not designed to be completely secure. The protocols used on the Internet do not ensure that all communications are secure. . | Q18: Incorrect. The Internet is not a data stream. . | Q19: Incorrect. The sum is too large to be represented with a 4-bit representation. . | Q23: Incorrect. While a runner’s position could be estimated using the runner’s average speed, a more accurate representation of the position over time can be achieved using a sampling technique. . | Q30: Incorrect. The algorithm used to round a numeric value to the nearest integer will be the same regardless of whether the value is stored in a list. . | Q34: Incorrect. While secondList initially contains [“flute”, “violin”], the contents of firstList and secondList are swapped later in the code segment. . | Q36: Incorrect.

This is the initial value of p. None of the variables has the value 10 after executing the code segment. . | Q44: Incorrect. For any integer n, the value of n MOD 1 is always 0. . | Q45: Incorrect. The code segment iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise.

            "content": "Things I saw . At Night at the museum, I got to see the amazing workings of many people. This included things like tetris, hangman, and many other even more complex projects. The most amazing project to me was the one that Varalu, Azeem, and Chinmay made. They made a working educational organizer that allows you to create an account and set up dates for assignments in a calender. They did this all by hand and every api they used was made by them. . Other stuff that was cool . I got to see friends from other classes of CSP that I didn’t even know were taking the class. These friends made a timer website with an alarm and a weather website that allows you to change your location to change which weather you see and from where it is. Another cool thing was being able to take a break in the sound-proof boxes. These boxes were dead silent and it was amazing getting to take a break from the action for a few seconds in there. Since the noise was so bad because of how many people were stuffed together in these rooms, this was the best break I could have had. . Things I disliked about Night At The Museum . I did not like how there were around 150 people stuffed into two classrooms. This made the rooms loud, stinky, and very warm. Also, it was a pain trying to navigate your way through them. I feel like a possible solution to this would be to spread Night At The museum over the course of multiple nights. This would change Night At The Museum to Nights At The Museum, but it would help with how crowded the room is. . Things I liked about Night At The Museum . I liked getting to see how other people creaeted their projects. Since I hadn’t gotten to look at other class periods yet, it was also cool getting to see them. Also, getting to talk with people in CSP without them being stressed was pretty cool because most of the time, they are really stressed which makes them not want to talk with you, instead choosing to focus on their work (which is a fair choice). . Issues we faced . We ran into some issues with our aws and our flask. This resulted in us running into some complications wtih the api. These issues were mainly that the api was unable to retrieve the data from the website without the flask or aws running. Also, our backend was unable to get our snake game to have a reset button on it, so whenever you died, you had to reload the tab. If you are playing the game a lot, it can be really annoying to have to reload it over and over again which was why I wanted it fixed. Also, the backend wanted to add a red object which was similar to the apples, but it blew you up instead of giving you an extra block worth of length. This never ended up being added because of the time crunch we had. Also, I did not have many speaking points during our presentation (which probably hurt my grade). But, my group members wouldn’t let me speak for fear of me messing something up. I don’t know what the real reason behind them thinking I mess literally everything up is, but I do not like it. . Summary . Night at the museum was fun but also had its drawbacks, my team ran into some issues along the way that almost took away many points from our assignment. The other groups did amazing jobs with their creations as well as their presentations. While the room was hot, stuffed full of people, and stinky, getting to see people’s projects was pretty cool. Being able to see people from other classes and what they were working on was refreshing because the projects from our period honestly kinda sucked compared to theirs (besides Varalu). If I had to make one change about Night At The Museum, I would spread it out across 2 or 3 days and change the name to Nights at the museum because the stuffy room was overly loud, warm, and smelly. Although this may be kinda difficult to do because there would be more chance of interference with another event, I still think its worth doing. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives: . | Identify input(s) to a program. | Identify output(s) produced by a program. Essential Knowledge: . | Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. | Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution. | Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . | tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) How do programs recieve input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . | “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program. What type of “events” can a user trigger? | mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | physical button clicks | keyboard entries | audio trigger (key word or phrase) What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. What are outputs produced by a device? . | visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text What sort of output do your devices supply? | Smart phone/tablet | Laptop computer | Gaming Console How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . | Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device. The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event: | The code segment is executed. | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered). The program code is not necessarily executed “in order”: | Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered. Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . | Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions. Essential Knowledge: . | A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations. | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it. | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function. What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements. . | A statement is a single command. | A group of statements is called a code segment. | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language. | A program is often referred to as software. How can we describe this code segment? . The description should: . | Simply state what it does so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program | . | Or include how it does what it does: by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | .",

Right after we understood what we needed to do for this project, we started brainstorming. Since both of us have done this type of project in app lab in the past, we knew that it would be easy. After a short period of time, we decided that making a simple quiz was the best and went with a colors quiz. . Creation thoughts . This is what we were thinking while producing our project. This includes struggles and successes that occured throughout it’s creation . Some of the first struggles we experienced were with how to link one slide to the next through an image. We quickly solved this by realizing that we could put the button below the image and link that to the next slide. The next one we struggled with was deciding which bacground to choose. I wanted to do something in dark-mode while Naja wanted to do something that was more playful with child-like colors. We ended up going with the more playful colors because that matched our colors quiz that we designed. . Sucesses/Learning Opportunities . This section includes what we learned while working on this project and what we had the easiest time doing. . First of all, what did we learn? . Considering the fact that we already did classes on code.org in middle school, it isnt much. But, Naja and I learned how to do the dropdown menus involved with clicking in certain locations. . What were some successes we had during this? . We already knew how to do most of the coding which was a huge advantage here because it made producing a project way quicker. We also had extra ideas along the way which helps us hopefully get a better grade. .",

Program design always starts with an idea and specific purpose in mind that requires you to follow specific steps and stick to a plan. This sometimes endsup being more exporatory than anything else. | Programs are started by investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. The developers must determine requirements of the program, understand the constraints (time, file size, etc.), understand the concerns and interests of th users. Developers investigate these by using surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations | Programs are developed by brainstorming, storyboarding, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and developing testing startegies | Developers need to decide on the program reqirements that decrsibe how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions. The proram specifications must outline all of the requirements. Developers must also create a prototype of the program (or the componenets). (prototyping is very important) Programs are also developed by developers testing out the program every step of the way. This may occur during big or small steps (at the micro or macro level). The main goal of this is to refine and/or revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily video 2 . program development is really rare to see as a solo project. This means that teams of 2 or more are the most common to see developing a program. Different individuals / teams work on different parts of a program such as front end development or back end development. Each member of the project deserves equal credit as the next. Working on one of these projects is really impressive and hard work for everyone no matter what role they played in development. The developer’s names are required to be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. | Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. Essential Knowledge . | Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . | describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . | At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . | Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",
