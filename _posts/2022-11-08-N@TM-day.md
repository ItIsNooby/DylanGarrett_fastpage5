## Things I saw
At Night at the museum, I got to see the amazing workings of many people. This included things like tetris, hangman, and many other even more complex projects. The most amazing project to me was the one that Varalu, Azeem, and Chinmay made. They made a working educational organizer that allows you to create an account and set up dates for assignments in a calender. They did this all by hand and every api they used was made by them.

## Other stuff that was cool
I got to see friends from other classes of CSP that I didn't even know were taking the class. These friends made a timer website with an alarm and a weather website that allows you to change your location to change which weather you see and from where it is. Another cool thing was being able to take a break in the sound-proof boxes. These boxes were dead silent and it was amazing getting to take a break from the action for a few seconds in there. Since the noise was so bad because of how many people were stuffed together in these rooms, this was the best break I could have had.

## Things I disliked about Night At The Museum
I did not like how there were around 150 people stuffed into two classrooms. This made the rooms loud, stinky, and very warm. Also, it was a pain trying to navigate your way through them. I feel like a possible solution to this would be to spread Night At The museum over the course of multiple nights. This would change Night At The Museum to Nights At The Museum, but it would help with how crowded the room is.

## Things I liked about Night At The Museum
I liked getting to see how other people creaeted their projects. Since I hadn't gotten to look at other class periods yet, it was also cool getting to see them. Also, getting to talk with people in CSP without them being stressed was a reallyc ool thing because most of the time, they are really stressed which makes them not want to talk with you, instead choosing to focus on their work (which is a fair choice).
