# Our thought process
## First thoughts
### This section includes what we were first thinking of on the first day after this was assigned.

Right after we understood what we needed to do for this project, we started brainstorming. Since both of us have done this type of project in app lab in the past, we knew that it would be easy. After a short period of time, we decided that making a simple quiz was the best and went with a colors quiz.

## Creation thoughts
### This is what we were thinking while producing our project. This includes struggles and successes that occured throughout it's creation

Some of the first struggles we experienced were with how to link one slide to the next through an image. We quickly solved this by realizing that we could put the button below the image and link that to the next slide. The next one we struggled with was deciding which bacground to choose. I wanted to do something in dark-mode while Naja wanted to do something that was more playful with child-like colors. We ended up going with the more playful colors because that matched our colors quiz that we designed.

## Sucesses/Learning Opportunities
### This section includes what we learned while working on this project and what we had the easiest time doing.

#### First of all, what did we learn?
Considering the fact that we already did classes on code.org in middle school, it isnt much. But, Naja and I learned how to do the dropdown menus involved with clicking in certain locations.

#### What were some successes we had during this?
We already knew how to do most of the coding which was a huge advantage here because it made producing a project way quicker. We also had extra ideas along the way which helps us hopefully get a better grade.
