# 1.3 collegeboard notes
## Daily video 1
* Program design always starts with an idea and specific purpose in mind that requires you to follow specific steps and stick to a plan. This sometimes endsup being more exporatory than anything else.
* Programs are started by investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. The developers must determine requirements of the program, understand the constraints (time, file size, etc.), understand the concerns and interests of th users. Developers investigate these by using surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations
* Programs are developed by brainstorming, storyboarding, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and developing testing startegies
* Developers need to decide on the program reqirements that decrsibe how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions. The proram specifications must outline all of the requirements. Developers must also create a prototype of the program (or the componenets). (prototyping is very important)
Programs are also developed by developers testing out the program every step of the way. This may occur during big or small steps (at the micro or macro level). The main goal of this is to refine and/or revise through testing, feedback, and reflection.

## Daily video 2
* program development is really rare to see as a solo project. This means that teams of 2 or more are the most common to see developing a program. Different individuals / teams work on different parts of a program such as front end development or back end development. Each member of the project deserves equal credit as the next. Working on one of these projects is really impressive and hard work for everyone no matter what role they played in development. The developer's names are required to be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project.
Program development is rarely a solo endeavor.
* Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle.
* Individuals/teams work on different functional components.
* Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work.
* Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project.
While documentation is an important place to give credit:
* Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit.
* This is an important part of the development of the program.
* When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem.
* This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs.
Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others.
* These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited.
* This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article.
* Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author.
* The program documentation should influde the author's name and the source of any code segments being used.
* This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper.

## Lesson Objectives
* Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.
## Essential Knowledge
* Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed.
* Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs.
* Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.
* Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired.
## How is a program developed?
Programmers create something called program documentation in order to:
* describe the overall program
* list program specifications
* describe:
    * functions/procedures/methods within the code
    * specific code segments
    * list of events and corresponding outputs
    * the development of the program
    * how other programs may interact with the program
* list of contributors/authors of the program
## When does documentation happen?
Documentation happens throughout the development of the program:
* At the beginning: list of specifications
* During: to keep track of process
* After: to explain the overall process
Documentation throught can improve:
* efficiency of overall programming process
* programmers' ability to test and refine the program
* programmers' response to bugs
## How do programmers document while programming?
Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not.
* Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program.
* This text does not affect the program.
* Comments are for programmers to read.
* This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually.
