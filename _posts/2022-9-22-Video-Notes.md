# 1.2 Notes
## Daily Video 1
#### Learning Objectives:
- Describe the purpose of a computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
- An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
##### Computing Innovations
Categories of Innovations:
- Applications
    - Games
    - Social Media
    - Business
    - Productivity
- Physical Devices
    - Computers
    - Smart Phones/Tablets
    - Smart "Things"
    - Wearables
- Systems
    - E-commerce
    - Cloud services
    - E-mail
#### Essential Knowledge:
- The purpose ofcomputing innovations is to solve provlems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
- An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
## Daily Video 2
#### Learning Objectives:
- Identify input(s) to a program.
- Identify output(s) produced by a program.
#### Essential Knowledge:
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
-  Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.
-  Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program.
#### Identifying Inputs to Programs
Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:
- tactile (touch)
- audio
- visual
- text (including numerical values)
#### How do programs recieve input?
Most programs are written in an event driven environment.
- "Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program.
What type of "events" can a user trigger?
- mouse clicks
- screen taps/swipes (force touch)
- physical button clicks
- keyboard entries
- audio trigger (key word or phrase)
#### What does input accomplish in a program?
Input usually affects the output.
What are outputs produced by a device?
- visual
- audio
- tactile (touch/feel)
- text
What sort of output do your devices supply?
- Smart phone/tablet
- Laptop computer
- Gaming Console
#### How does a program know what to do upon an event?
An action triggers an event:
- Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device.
The program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event:
- The code segment is executed.
- Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered).
The program code is not necessarily executed "in order":
- Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered.
## Daily Video 3
#### Learning Objectives:
- Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions.
#### Essential Knowledge:
- A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software.
- A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.
- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.
- The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.
- A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function.
#### What is a program?
A program is a collection of statements.
- A statement is a single command.
- A group of statements is called a code segment.
- Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language.
- A program is often referred to as software.
#### How can we describe this code segment?
The description should:
- Simply state what it does
    - so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program
- Or include how it does what it does:
    - by explaining in detail how the code segment functions
